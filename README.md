# NBA-Combined-MVP-Projection
A project of mine which analyzes basketball player performance and determines the NBA's most elite players in the 2019-2020 regular season and playoffs combined. The code retrieves player and team data from basketball-reference.com and ESPN, applies data manipulation techniques, and performs curve fitting and scoring calculations. By combining and transforming the data, I evaluated player performance to find the overall season MVP (regular season + playoffs). Included in this repository are the PowerPoint for the presentation I gave at the Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium, and the Jupyter Notebook containing the data manipulation and analytics completed for this project.
